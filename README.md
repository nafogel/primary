# primary
The first indie game I ever published, Primary is a puzzle game that lets you combine and clear colored tiles.

## About
Primary was developed using the [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/https://cordova.apache.org/) framework and is written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavScript.

## How to run
[Download](https://github.com/nafogel/primary/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/nafogel/primary.git) the respository, and then open `index.html` in your preferred browser (Primary was developed and tested in Google Chrome, so it will most likely work best with Chrome).  
  
Additionally, there is a `create.html` file that can be used to generate new puzzles. This file generates an array that can be added to `js/maps.js` in order to create new levels.
